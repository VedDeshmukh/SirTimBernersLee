        <p>One of many hobbies that I enjoy is coding. I personally enjoy coding because of the challenge it brings, and the infinite possibilites it brings. At times, you can get lucky and write the code with no problem. Although, you are more likley to run into at least one mistake while coding. This can greatly help you by teaching you to think hard and solve the puzzle. Coding is also a hobby that gives you the ability to make anything. You can make anything from calculators to translators, the possibilites are almost endless. Overall, coding is one of my favorite hobbies because of the challenge it provides, and the fun it brings.</p>
